## Supabase Email Configuration

### Before Setup
- **Status**: Email provider not configured
- **Issue**: Cannot enable "Prevent use of leaked passwords" security feature
- **Impact**: Authentication emails not sent

### After Setup âœ…
- **SMTP Server**: smtp.mailgun.org
- **Port**: 587
- **Username**: hello@bsldb.app
- **Password**: [configured in Supabase]
- **From Address**: hello@bsldb.app
- **Status**: Configured and ready

## Security Improvements Addressed

### Completed
- âœ… **OTP Long Expiry**: Fixed in Supabase dashboard (set to 3600 seconds/1 hour)

### Future (Pro Plan Required)
- ðŸ’° **Leaked Password Protection**: Requires Supabase Pro plan upgrade

### Future Considerations
- ðŸŸ¡ **Function Search Path Warnings**: Low priority database function security improvements

## Alternative Options Considered

### DNS Providers
- **Cloudflare**: Excellent features, but switching would be complex since Vercel already manages DNS well
- **IONOS**: Current registrar, poor interface for DNS management
- **Decision**: Stay with Vercel DNS for simplicity

### Email Providers
- **Gmail SMTP**: Free but limited, uses personal account
- **Supabase Built-in**: Requires paid plan upgrade
- **Mailgun**: Chosen for generous free tier and future newsletter capabilities
- **SendGrid**: Good but lower free tier (100/day vs 5000/month)
- **Brevo**: Middle ground option (300/day)

## Future Enhancements

### Email Marketing
- Newsletter signup integration
- User segmentation for targeted emails
- Email templates and automation
- Analytics and tracking

### DNS Optimizations
- Consider Cloudflare for CDN and security features
- Implement additional security headers
- Monitor DNS performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **DNS propagation delays**: Can take up to 48 hours
- **Email deliverability**: New domains may have emails marked as spam initially
- **DKIM verification**: Most critical for email reputation

### Testing
- Use Mailgun's email validation tools
- Test authentication flows after setup
- Monitor email delivery rates

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor Mailgun usage (5,000/month limit)
- Review email delivery statistics
- Update DNS records if services change
- Renew SSL certificates (automatic via Vercel)

### Monitoring
- Supabase Security Advisor for ongoing warnings
- Mailgun dashboard for email metrics
- Vercel analytics for DNS performance
