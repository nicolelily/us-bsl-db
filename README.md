# U.S. Breed Specific Legislation Database

This application serves as a comprehensive resource for tracking breed-specific legislation (BSL) across municipalities in the United States. BSL refers to laws that regulate or ban certain dog breeds based on their perceived danger to public safety.

Our database includes information on:

Municipality names and types (city or county)
Specific breeds included in legislation
Relevant ordinance or municipal code references
Population data where available
The goal of this resource is to provide accurate, up-to-date information on breed-specific legislation to assist pet owners, animal welfare organizations, lawmakers, and researchers.
