### 5. Update Navigation/Header
**File**: `src/components/Navigation.tsx`

- [ ] Replace with "personally curated, community-ready" messaging
- [ ] Ensure consistency across all components
- [ ] Update any tooltips or help text that reference contributors

### 8. Update Footer/Credits
**File**: Footer component or About page

### 9. Review Submission Workflow Text
**Files**: Submission wizard components

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order:
1. **High Priority**: ContributionPrompt and Homepage hero (most visible)
2. **Medium Priority**: About page and navigation updates
3. **Low Priority**: Documentation and screenshot updates

### Messaging Strategy:
- **Current**: "Join our community of contributors"
- **Updated**: "Help build our community of contributors"
- **Current**: "156+ contributors documenting legislation"
- **Updated**: "Comprehensive database ready for community contributions"

### Future Considerations:
- Plan to re-enable statistics when first real submission is approved
- Consider showing "0 community contributions" vs hiding entirely
- Think about celebrating the first real community contributor

## Testing Checklist
